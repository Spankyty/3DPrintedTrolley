# 3DPrintedTrolley
3D Printed RC Bluetooth Trolley from the play A Street Car Named Desire

Made for my 11th Grade Project. This is the first time I have modeled / 3D Printed so much... 
Well kinda since I found it on TinkerCad and edited it in Fusion 360.

The arduino code I rewrote then edited from www.ardumotive.com
